* Description
This layer installs and configures media library management software EMMS.

https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/

* Install

To use the media layer add it to your =~/.spacemacs=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq-default dotspacemacs-configuration-layers '(media))
#+end_src

Optionally, if you have a collection of media files in a single directory tree,
you can set the root directory of that tree as EMMS's default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq emms-source-file-default-directory "/path/to/music/")
#+end_src

When you first open the EMMS browser it will prompt you to add music. It then
builds a cache of track info, defaulting to the directory ~/.emacs.d/emms.
Before doing so install a track info reader to properly extract track
information, otherwise you will encounter errors and the track info will not be
read. We recommend you use
[TagLib](https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/#Using-TagLib), the one
included with EMMS, by compiling and installing it to your path.

#+begin_src shell 
$ cd
~/.emacs.d/elpa/emms-<version>/cd-here-and-make-emms-print-metadata-and-put-in-path/
$ make emms-print-metadata
#+end_src

If it compiles successfully, put the executable in your PATH (you can check
the value of PATH with the `getenv` command).  Now when you add music it should
populate the smart browser properly with names of tracks, albums, artists, etc.
Re-add your music by deleting the ~/.emacs.d/emms directory, where the cache and
history are located.

Find the home page and full manual here:
https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/
https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/manual/

Most importantly, you will need a media player. By default, the media layer is
set up to support mpg321, ogg123, mplayer, and vlc. Install one of these and
ensure that Emacs can find it in your PATH.


** EMMS configuration 
   The default configuration for EMMS in the media layer does not show tracks in
   the mode-line, in order to minimise intrusion upon those who do not wish to
   customise the layer.

   EMMS is configured with the following defaults:
   - all stable features of EMMS loaded
   - No track in mode-line
   - F7 to toggle emms smart browse
   - TagLib is the track info reader
   - Several key bindings have been changed to suite evil-mode

** Configuring media keys
   Configuring media keys (play/pause, next, previous) is system dependent, of
   course, but once you learn how to map them to terminal commands you can try
   something like the following:

   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-pause)" || \
   emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)"\
   --eval "(goto-line 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" \
   --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" || \
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)" \
   --eval "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)" \
   --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" || \
   say Open and cue up an E M M S playlist in emacs.
   #+end_src
   
   If the Emacs server is running and EMMS is loaded with at least one track in
   the emms-browser, then above command-line instruction will (in order) try to
   play a paused track, try to play the next track after the cursor in the
   playlist, choose an album at random and play it, adding the tracks to the
   playlist.  Failing all of that it issues an audible error message (which here
   uses a buit-in function on Mac OS X).
   
   Commands for previous and next buttons are similar:

   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-next)" || \
   emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)" --eval "(goto-line \
	 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" --eval \
	 "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" ||\
	 emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)"  --eval
	 "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)"
	 --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" ||  say Open and cue
	 up an E M M S playlist in emacs. 
   #+end_src
   
   #+begin_src sh
   emacsclient --eval "(emms-previous)" || \
	 emacsclient  --eval  "(emms-playlist-mode-go)" --eval "(goto-line \
	 1)" --eval "(emms-playlist-mode-play-smart)" --eval \
	 "(emms-playlist-mode-bury-buffer)" ||\
	 emacsclient --eval "(emms-browser)"  --eval
	 "(emms-browse-by-album)"  --eval "(emms-browser-goto-random)"
	 --eval "(emms-browser-add-tracks-and-play)" ||  say Open and cue
	 up an E M M S playlist in emacs.
   #+end_src
 
*** Setting the media keys on Mac OS X
    Mac OS X media keys can be rebound with Karabiner (formerly
    KeyRemap4MacBook). First, merge the file `private.xml` included in the media
    layer must with `~/Library/Application\ Support/Karabiner/private.xml`.
    Second, open Karabiner preferences and press "Reload XML". Third, and
    finally, tick the three boxes related to EMMS.
    
* Obtaining Cover Art
  You can add cover art to EMMS. Just add files `cover-small.jpg` and
  `cover-med.jpg` to album directories. You also prevent album cover art from
  appearing in the browser at all by adding
  #begin_src
  (setq emms-browser-covers nil)
  #end_src

  Cover art can be snarfed from the Web with the third-party program `beets`, and then
  resized with ImageMagik. It's a bit manual but it's also pretty easy. These
  instructions are adapted from this [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/3667/what-are-the-options-to-play-music-from-within-emacs/3741#3741][Stack Exchange answer]].

  [[http://beets.io/][Install `beets`]] and open the [[http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.19/guides/main.html][Quickstart page]] and do (more or less) the following:
     1. Create the music library file anywhere: e.g., `~/data/musiclibrary.blb`
     2. call `beet config -e` to create/edit a YAML config file for beets
     3. Add the lines:
        ```
        directory: "/path/to/music"
        library: "~/data/musiclibrary.blb"
        import:
          copy: no
          write: no
        plugins: fetchart
        ```
     4. Call `beet import -ql .` from `/path/to/music`.
        - `-ql` is for quiet and log modes.  If you want to use beets seriously, read the [[http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/tagger.html][docs on auto-tagging]].
        - Use `-g` if you have tracks from multiple albums in the same directory (I expect this is slower).
     5. Open the [[http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/fetchart.html][fetchart docs]] and do `pip install requests` to enable requests from the Web.
        - Execute `beet fetchart` and decide whether you are satisfied with its success rate.
        - If not, you can configure fetchart to search more sources by adding a `fetchart: ` tag to the beets config file (`beets config -e`), and try again.
     6. Install ImageMagik to use the `convert` function in the script below.
     7. Execute the script provided below, editing `/path/to/music`.  Note that it overwrites files named `cover_small.<cover file ext>`, `cover_med.<cover file ext>`.
  #+begin_src bash
#!/bin/sh
MUSICDIR="/path/to/music/"
# resize covers
#preferred small size, edit this.
SMALL_SIZE=50
#preferred med size, edit this.
MED_SIZE=200
find "$MUSICDIR" -iname "cover.jpg" |
find . -type f -iname 'cover.jpg' -exec bash -c '
  for file do
    EXTENSION="${file##*.}"
    FILENAME="${file%.*}"
    NEW_MED_NAME="${FILENAME}_med.${EXTENSION}"
    NEW_SMALL_NAME="${FILENAME}_small.${EXTENSION}"
    if [ ! -f "${NEW_MED_NAME}" ]; then
        convert "${file}" -adaptive-resize 200x200 "${NEW_MED_NAME}"
    fi
    if [ ! -f "${NEW_SMALL_NAME}" ]; then
       convert "${file}" -adaptive-resize 100x100 "${NEW_SMALL_NAME}"
    fi
  done
' bash {} +
  #+end_src

  Open the emms browser `SPC a RET` and type `b 2` to refresh the list and sort
  by album. Your cover art should appear now.

* Key bindings
  EMMS browser and playlist modes can be access with leader keys. In Vim-style
  Spacemacs leader keys are accessed with =SPC= (as described in the table) and
  with Emacs style Spacemacs they are accessed with =M-m=.

| Leader Key Binding | Description                                                      |

*** Mark Playlists 

In addition to most of the commands for normal playlists, Mark Playlists offer
the usual marking features. Operations should occur on all marked tracks.

| m           | Marks the current track and sets point one line forward. If a prefix argument ARG is given, it will mark the next ARG tracks and set point accordingly. A negative argument marks backward. |

| % m         | Marks all tracks in the playlist matching the given regular expression. A prefix argument means to unmark them instead.                                                                     |
